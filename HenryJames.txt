Henry James
by June Robertson Beisch
	
"Poor Mr. James," Virginia Woolf once said:
"He never quite met the right people."
Poor James. He never quite met the
children of light and so he had to invent them.
Then, when people said: No one is like that.
Your books are not reality, he replied:
So much the worse for reality.
He described himself as "slow to conclude,
orotund, a slow-moving creature, circling his rooms
slowly masticating his food."
Once, when a nephew asked his advice
on how to live, he searched his mind.
Number One, be kind, he said.
Number Two, be kind and
Number Three, be kind.
